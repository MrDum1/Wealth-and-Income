## Notes

Years are separated into a different number of rows depending on the context of the data. For data containing any "pct" columns means "percentage". In the `retirement` data table, column *"retirement"* refers to retirement savings between different races over the years (NOT the amount of people who retired).

Not all data sets have the same years. Some data sets have less years than others and some changing consecutively, others non-consecutively.

## Questions

Is there a relationship between home owner percentage over the years and retirement dollars? How does this correlate with races with the highest and lowest student debt overall?

Use data sets `home_owner`, `retirement`, and `student_debt`.
